I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford. My supervisors are <a href='https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/'>Arnaud Doucet </a> and <a href='https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/'>Tom Rainforth</a>. My research interests include generative models, variational inference and MCMC.

Recently, I have worked on denoising generative models for discrete data, viewing the process in continuous time and simulating with chemical physics inspired integrators. Previously, I have worked on online variational inference for sequential state space models by using links with reinforcement learning. I have also explored the links between variational inference and MCMC methods for more efficient sampling with applications to sampling molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution.

Before coming to Oxford, I completed a Masters in Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge where I was supervised by <a href='https://jmhl.org'>José Miguel Hernández-Lobato</a>.
