I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford. My supervisors are <a href='https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/'>Arnaud Doucet </a> and <a href='https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/'>Tom Rainforth</a>. I am broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning, generative models and variational inference.

I have worked on gradient based hyperparameter optimization through exploring the links between variational inference and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I have also worked on novel methods for online inference in sequential state space models with applications to tracking and extracting meaning from long video sequences.  

Before coming to Oxford, I completed a Masters in Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge where I was supervised by <a href='https://jmhl.org'>José Miguel Hernández-Lobato</a>.
