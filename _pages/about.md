I am a fourth year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford. My supervisors are <a href='https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/'>Arnaud Doucet </a> and <a href='https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/'>Tom Rainforth</a>.

During my PhD, I have worked on expanding the denoising diffusion methodology to a wider range of data types including discrete data and transdimensional data. I have applied these methods to scientific data including molecules and proteins.

Before coming to Oxford, I completed a Masters in Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge where I was supervised by <a href='https://jmhl.org'>José Miguel Hernández-Lobato</a>.
